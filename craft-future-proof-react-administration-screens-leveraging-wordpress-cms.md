# Craft Future-Proof React Administration Screens Leveraging WordPress CMS

When I began my journey as a web developer years ago, the prospect of creating custom administrative interfaces felt like a formidable challenge. Crafting modular, reusable components appeared to be a skill reserved for seasoned engineers at large agencies.

Fast forward to today, and as a frontend developer at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), I've had the opportunity to work on numerous admin dashboards powered by headless CMS systems using React. The advancement of frameworks and tools has made what once seemed complex accessible to a wider range of developers.

One thing I've observed is that while many tutorials cover the basics of setting up a React app to consume WordPress data, they often lack guidance on architecting reusable, future-proof solutions. They also fall short in providing best practices for code organization, state management, and long-term feature expansion.

Having tackled these challenges firsthand on client projects at Hybrid, I'm excited to present a comprehensive tutorial on building a fully-fledged modular admin dashboard interface. The approach I'll demonstrate centers around separating presentational and container components, implementing custom hooks for data management and side effects, and establishing a robust foundation that readily accommodates the addition of new admin modules.

Rather than just connecting to a REST API, my goal is to guide you in creating an admin application using the best practices for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. By the end, you'll be equipped with practical techniques for structuring modular React applications driven by WordPress as a CMS, eliminating the need for guesswork or reinventing the wheel with each new feature.

## Setting Up WordPress as a Headless CMS

The first step is to install WordPress. You can download and extract the files to your local development environment or deploy WordPress on a hosting provider. For this demonstration, I'll be using MAMP on my local machine.

Once WordPress is set up, we need to enable the REST API functionality. This allows frontend applications to interact with WordPress data through RESTful endpoints. To achieve this, navigate to Plugins > Add New and search for "REST API." Install and activate the REST API plugin.

Next, we configure the core API permissions by adding the following code to our theme's `functions.php` file:

```php
function enable_any_rest_request() {
  remove_filter('rest_pre_serve_request', 'rest_send_cors_headers');
}
add_action('rest_api_init', 'enable_any_rest_request');
```

This piece of code permits requests from any domain, which is particularly crucial during development when our React app resides on a different origin.

The subsequent step involves registering custom post types, allowing our React app to retrieve and manage customized content types beyond the core WordPress post types like posts and pages. We'll create a custom post type named "Projects" by adding the following code:

```php
function create_project_post_type() {
  register_post_type('project',
    array(
      'labels' => array(
        'name' => __('Projects'),
      ),
    )
  );
}
add_action('init', 'create_project_post_type');
```

## Building the React Admin App

To kickstart our React app, run the following command: `npx create-react-app admin-app`. This command sets up a basic React project that serves as the foundation for our dashboard.

Our initial component is `Posts.js`, responsible for fetching and displaying post data from WordPress. We import the `useEffect` hook and make a GET request to the `POSTS` endpoint:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setPosts(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This code covers the essentials of setting up WordPress as a headless CMS and rendering the data within our React interface. In the upcoming sections, we'll introduce functionality for creating and updating posts and establish routing.

## Fetching Posts Data

The `useEffect` hook allows us to retrieve data from the API when the component mounts. We import `useEffect` and define state variables for the `posts` array and a `loading` state:

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // API call
  }, []);
}
```

Within the `useEffect` block, we send a GET request to the WordPress REST API posts endpoint. Once the response is received, we parse the JSON data and save it to the state. This triggers a re-render of the component with the new data:

```js
fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
  .then res => res.json()
  .then data => {


    setPosts(data);
    setLoading(false);
  });
```

## Displaying Posts

With the posts data in hand, it's time to present it. We'll create a `Post` component designed to render each individual post. This component receives the post as a prop and extracts the relevant fields.

We'll also structure the overall layout and apply styling using Material UI grid, cards, and typography components to achieve a clean and organized interface.

Within `Posts.js`, we map over the `posts` state array and render a `Post` component for each post. This ensures that the title, excerpt, and other fields are displayed in an appealing grid format.

## Adding Posts

To handle post creation, we'll utilize the `useState` hook to keep track of input values and errors in the state. We define an initial state object and the necessary setter functions.

Validation and submission are managed through the Formik library. When a post is submitted, it invokes a `handleSubmit` function that triggers an API request to create a new post.

We'll also implement error handling to display meaningful error messages if the API request encounters issues. This approach offers a superior user experience compared to generic alerts.

## Routing and Layout

For defining routes and navigation within our single-page application, we rely on React Router. We initialize Router and define route paths for the main pages of our admin dashboard.

Common user interface elements like headers are abstracted into reusable components, `Header.js` and `Sidebar.js`. These components are rendered on every route using the `props.children` pattern.

Additionally, we conditionally display button links for adding new posts and navigating between sections using the React Router `Link` component. This ensures that all parts of our dashboard are interconnected within a polished and cohesive admin interface.

## Embracing Modularity

With the fundamental aspects of fetching, displaying, and managing posts in place, it's time to enhance our code's modularity and reusability. This involves extracting shared logic and user interface elements into custom hooks and components.

A logical starting point is the data-fetching logic. While our current approach includes `useEffect` calls directly within our `Posts` component, we can abstract this logic for reuse. Let's create a `useApiData` hook designed to handle GET requests and return the retrieved data:

```js
function useApiData(endpoint) {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(endpoint)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, [endpoint]);

  return data;
}
```

With this hook in place, we can simplify the `Posts` component by calling it:

```js
function Posts() {
  const posts = useApiData('/posts');
  return (
    <PostList posts={posts} />
  )
}
```

This refactoring optimizes our data-fetching logic, making it reusable across various components.

As we expand the set of admin features, we can organize sections into logical feature modules that fully encapsulate related user interface and logic. Let's introduce a "Profiles" section for managing site users. We'll create a `Profiles` module with its own route, and, as you might expect, we'll leverage the `useApiData` hook for data retrieval:

```js
function Profiles() {
  const profiles = useApiData('/profiles');
  return (
    <ProfileList profiles={profiles} />
  );
}
```

By developing modular, reusable components, our codebase becomes more organized and easier to maintain when adding new features. Common utilities like hooks help prevent code duplication throughout the application. This structure also provides a high degree of customization for our admin dashboard. Modules can be included or excluded as needed, and other sections, such as settings, can follow the same modular pattern.

In conclusion, focusing on modularity and the separation of concerns ensures that our admin dashboard scales gracefully as requirements evolve over time, especially in Fort Wayne.

## Conclusion
